# What? No repositories?

I believe that "embracing AI" is something our industry got horribly wrong. I won't be participating in anything that even resembles it. [GitHub being at the forefront of it](https://ashtom.github.io/developers-reinvented) is why I decided to move all my repositories to a private forge. I won't be contributing to any projects hosted at GitHub unless I'm paid to do so. Even then I refuse to use Copilot or any other AI. You can’t pay me enough to do that.

You can find my stuff on [my website](https://lukas.stancik.work/). This account is kept here as a placeholder.
